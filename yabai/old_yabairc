#YABAI CONFIG for DANIEL HUFNAGLE

#-----LAYOUT-----#

# FLOATING/TILING
# Layout defines whether windows are tiled ("managed", "bsp") by yabai or left alone ("float").
yabai -m config layout bsp

# WINDOW PLACEMENT
# Window_placement defines where new windows appear (first_child = new windows tile to the top or left, second_child = new windows tile to bottom or right)
yabai -m config window_placement second_child

# PADDING/GAPS
# paddings are towards the menu bar, dock, and screen edges
# gaps are between windows
# padding is in pixels
yabai -m config top_padding 12
yabai -m config bottom_padding 12
yabai -m config left_padding 12
yabai -m config right_padding 12
yabai -m config window_gap 12

# SPLIT RATIOS
# auto balance makes it so all windows always occupy the same space, independent of how deeply nester they are in the window tree
# yabai -m config auto_balance off
# if auto balance is disabled, the split ration defines how much space each window occupies after a new split is created. A value of 0.5 means that both new and old winows occupy the same space, a value of 0.2 means that the old window occupies 20% of the space and the new window occupies 80%
# yabai -m config split_ratio 0.5

# MOUSE SUPPORT
# set the modifier key for the mouse options are fn, alt, ctrl (I haven't tried control, but I know alt and fn work)
yabai -m config mouse_modifier alt
# set modifier + left-click drag to move window
yabai -m config mouse_action1 move
# set modifier + right-click drag to resize window
yabai -m config mouse_action2 resize
# sets focus follows mouse (default off: options - off, autoraise, autofocus)
#yabai -m config focus_follows_mouse autoraise
# sets mouse follows focus mode (default off)
# yabai -m config mouse_follows_focus on

# add configuration to adjust for the topbar (either sketchybar or simplebar)
#yabai -m config external_bar main:25:0

# disable specific apps from begin managed with yabai
# the apps I commented out are ones I've decided I want to have stack, which I do with
# keyboard shortcuts.
